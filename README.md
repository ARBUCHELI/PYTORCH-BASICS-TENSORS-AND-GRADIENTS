### Interoperability with Numpy

Numpy is a popular open source library used for mathematical and scientific computing in Python. It enables efficient operations on 
large multi-dimensional arrays, and has a large ecosystem of supporting libraries:

*   Matplotlib for plotting and visualization
*   OpenCV for image and video processing
*   Pandas for file I/O and data analysis

<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>

1. Type each line of code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
2. Or find the [original jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ARBUCHELI/00464b8813904a69e0598805f584788e/pytorch-basics-tensors-and-gradients.ipynb) and run the cells in Google Colab.
